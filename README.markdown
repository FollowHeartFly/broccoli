# broccoli
**broccoli** is a question asking and answering module created as a final project for [11-411: Natural Language Processing](http://www.makeitunderstand.org/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://cmu.edu/) in Spring 2008.

It was created by Zach Paine, Owen Yamauchi, Emilie McConville, and Mattt Thompson. Our professor and Virgil through the perils of computational linguistics was [Noah A. Smith](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/).

The basic function is to take in a corpus of [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) articles in order to generate and answer questions about that article. As per the specs of the project assignment, we focused our efforts on articles about [Animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names), [Countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries), and [Presidents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States).</p>
