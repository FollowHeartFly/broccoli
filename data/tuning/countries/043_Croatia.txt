Croatia (IPA: /kroʊˈeɪʃə/) (Croatian: Hrvatska), officially the Republic of Croatia (Republika Hrvatska listen (help·info)), is a country at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, Central Europe, and the Balkans. Its capital is Zagreb. Croatia borders with Slovenia and Hungary to the north, Serbia to the northeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the east, and Montenegro to the far southeast. Its southern and western flanks border the Adriatic Sea. Croatia is a candidate for membership of the European Union and received NATO membership invitation on 3 April 2008. On October 17, 2007 Croatia became a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2008-2009 term.

The Croats settled in the Balkans and formed two Principalities: Dalmatia and Pannonia. The establishment of the Trpimirovic dynasty ca 850 brought strengthening to the Dalmatian Croat Duchy, which became a Kingdom in 925.

In 1102 Croatia entered into a personal union with the Hungarian Kingdom. After the 1526 Battle of Mohacs the "reliqiae reliqiarum" of Croatia became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527. In 1918 Croatia joined the Kingdom of Serbia into a Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia).

In 1941-1945 an Axis puppet-state known as the Independent State of Croatia existed. After it suffered a defeat at the hand of the Allies, Croatia became a constitutive federal republic of the SFRY.

In 1991 Croatia proclaimed independence by holding the first democratic elections in the country but had to fight a long and bloody war until 1995.

Croatia was recognized on January 15th 1992 by the European Union and the UN. First country to recognize Croatia was Iceland few days before.

Croatia is located in South-Central Europe. Its shape resembles that of a crescent or a horseshoe, which flanks its neighbours Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. To the north lie Slovenia and Hungary; Italy lies across the Adriatic Sea. Its mainland territory is split in two non-contiguous parts by the short coastline of Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.

Its terrain is diverse, including:

The country is famous for its many national parks. Croatia has a mixture of climates. In the north and east it is continental, Mediterranean along the coast and a semi-highland and highland climate in the south-central region.

Offshore Croatia consists of over one thousand islands varying in size. The largest islands in Croatia are Cres and Krk which are located in the Adriatic Sea. The Danube, the longest river in the European Union, runs through the city of Vukovar.

Since the adoption of the 1990 Constitution, Croatia has been a democratic republic. Between 1990 and 2000 it had a semi-presidential system, and since 2000 it has a parliamentary system.

The President of the Republic (Predsjednik) is the head of state, directly elected to a four-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the Prime minister with the consent of the Parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy. His official residence is Predsjednički dvori. Apart from that he has summer residences on the islands of Vanga (Brijuni islands) and the island of Hvar.

The Croatian Parliament (Sabor) is a unicameral legislative body (a second chamber, the "House of Counties", which was set up by the Constitution of 1990, was abolished in 2001). The number of the Sabor's members can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The plenary sessions of the Sabor take place from January 15 to July 15, and from September 15 to December 15.

The Croatian Government (Vlada) is headed by the Prime minister who has two deputy prime ministers and fourteen ministers in charge of particular sectors of activity. The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic. Government's official residence is at Banski dvori.

Croatia has a three-tiered judicial system, consisting of the Supreme Court, county courts, and municipal courts. The Constitutional Court rules on matters regarding the Constitution.

Croatia is divided into 20 counties (županija) and the capital Zagreb's city district (in italics below):

The Croatian economy has a stable functioning market economy which is one of the most advanced of South-Eastern Europe. International Monetary Fund data shows that Croatian nominal GDP stood at US$50.053 billion, or US$11,271 per capita, in 2007. The IMF forecast for 2008 is US$54.950 billion, or US$12,374 per capita. In purchasing power parity terms, total GDP was US$69.866 billion in 2007, equivalent to US$15,733 per capita. For 2008, it is forecast to be US$74.419 billion, or US$16,758 per capita.

According to Eurostat data, Croatian PPS GDP per capita stood at 53.4 per cent of the EU average in 2007, and is forecast to reach 54.1 per cent in 2008. Real GDP growth in 2007 was 6.0 per cent. The average gross salary in 2007 was 6,634 kuna per month. In 2007, the International Labour Organization-defined unemployment rate stood at 9.1 per cent, after falling steadily from 14.7 per cent in 2002. The registered unemployment rate is higher, though, standing at 14.7 per cent in December 2007.

In 2007, 7.2 per cent of economic output was accounted for by agriculture, 32.8 per cent by industry and 60.7 per cent by the service sector. According to 2004 data, 2.7 per cent of the workforce were employed in agriculture, 32.8 per cent by industry and 64.5 in services.

The industrial sector is dominated by shipbuilding, food processing and the chemical industry. Tourism is a notable source of income during the summer, with over 10 million foreign tourists in 2006 generating a revenue of €8 billion. Croatia is ranked as the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. In 2006 Croatia exported goods to the value of USD$10.4 billion (FOB) (US$19.7 billion including service exports).

Of particular concern is the backlogged judiciary system, combined with inefficient public administration, especially issues of land ownership and corruption. Another main problem includes the large and growing national debt which has reached over 30 billion dollars.

The country has been preparing for membership in the European Union, its most important trading partner. In February 2005, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU officially came into force.

The population of Croatia has been stagnating over the last decade. The 1991–1995 war in Croatia had previously displaced large parts of the population and increased emigration. Most Serbs of Croatia has been prepared to leave Croatia  by Republic of Serbian Krajina and during Operation Storm on order given by Serb Supreme Defence Council they have left . All in all between 200,000  and 300,000  Serbs have left Croatia. Around 78,000 Croats  has been earlier forcibly removed by Krajina government but they have latter returned, on other side only minority of Serbs has returned after leaving Croatia. The natural growth rate is minute or negative (less than ± 1%), as the demographic transition has been completed half a century ago. Average life expectancy is approximately 75 years, and the literacy rate is 99%.

Croatia is inhabited mostly by Croats (89.9%). There are around twenty minorities. Serbs, though they were much larger before war , being the largest one (4.5%). The predominant religion is Catholicism (87.8%), with some Orthodox (4.4%) and Sunni Muslim (1.3%) minorities.

The official and common language, Croatian, is a South Slavic language, using the Latin alphabet. Less than 5% of the population cites other languages as their mother tongues.
