Steers is a fast-food franchise burger restaurant chain originating from South Africa. It sells mainly flame grilled beef and chicken burgers under its credo "real food made real good".

The restaurant chain can trace its roots back to 1960, when the founder of the company, George Halamandaris, visited the United States and decided that he would bring the fast-food concept back to South Africa; however, the first Steers restaurant was only opened in Jeppe, Johannesburg in 1970.

Since 1985, Steers retails products such as sauces have been sold in South African supermarkets. In 1994, the Steers Holdings Group was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The Group was later renamed Famous Brands, which also includes other restaurant chains such as Wimpy, Debonairs Pizza, FishAways, House of Coffees, Brazilian, Market Caf√© and Whistle Stop.

As of 2006, Steers had more than 350 restaurants in operation worldwide. Since 1997 many Steers restaurants have also begun to offer a Drive-Thru

Steers predominantly sells beef and chicken hamburgers, subs, sandwiches, french fries, soft drinks, and desserts.

Steers operates within the "higher end" niche of the South African fast food market. Compared to rivals such as McDonalds, Steers has a larger and more varied menu, selling fast food that is typically more expensive and requires more preparation time. Steers' advertising justifies this by appealing to the superior taste and quality of its products.

Among South African consumers, Steers is well-known for its "Wacky Wednesday" special, a "two for the price of one" burger special that is only sold on Wednesdays. The exact nature of the "Wacky Wednesday" changes on a monthly basis.
