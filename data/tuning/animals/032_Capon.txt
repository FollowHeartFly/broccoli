A 4.5 kg (10 pound) capon ready for roasting.

A capon is a cockerel (a male chicken) whose reproductive organs were removed at a young age. Typically, the castration is performed when the chicken is between 6 and 20 weeks old.

The benefits are a non-aggressive male that can serve as a mother for baby chicks. They also produce ample, tender meat when butchered and as such are a choice poultry meat in some locales.

Due to the high fat content, they are self-basting.

The caponisation of poultry is banned in the United Kingdom on animal welfare grounds, though the meat itself is not illegal.
