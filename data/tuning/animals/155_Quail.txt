Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds in the pheasant family Phasianidae, or in the family Odontophoridae. New World quails are not closely related but so named for their similar appearance and behaviour. Buttonquails are in a different family (Turnicidae) and are not true quails.

Quails are small, plump terrestrial birds. They are seed eaters but will also take insects and similar small prey. They nest on the ground and are capable of short, rapid bursts of flight. Some species such as the Japanese and Common Quail are migratory and fly for long distances.  Some quail are farmed in large numbers. The Japanese Quail (or coturnix quail) is kept mostly to produce eggs.
