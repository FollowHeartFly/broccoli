Raven is the common name given to the largest species of passerine birds in the genus Corvus. Corvids are also commonly referred to as crows and other species in the same genus include jackdaws and rooks.

In most of Europe and North America, raven is used as a synonym for the widespread Common Raven, and much of the literature and culture surrounding ravens refers to that species.

Ravens have high intelligence and are perhaps the smartest birds. Their intelligence might be on par with canids such as wolves.

An obsolete collective noun for a group of ravens (or at least the Common Raven) is an "unkindness".
