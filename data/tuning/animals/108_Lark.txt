Larks are passerine birds of the predominantly Old World family Alaudidae. Only one species, the Shore Lark, has spread to North America, where it is called the Horned Lark.

Larks are small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. This fact, combined with a willingness to expand into anthropogenic habitats — as long as these are not too intensively managed — has ensured larks a prominent place in literature and music (the skylark being eulogised in "The Lark Ascending" (1914) by Ralph Vaughan Williams, for example).

Larks nest on the ground, laying 2–6 speckled eggs. Like many ground birds, most lark species have long hind claws, which are thought to provide stability while standing.

Most larks are fairly dull in appearance. They feed on insects and seeds.

Larks symbolise happiness, hope, good fortune, freedom, joy, youth, creativity and a new day.
